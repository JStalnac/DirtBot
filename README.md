# DirtBot
 The unfinished source code for DirtBot
 
# Github code archive
 This is my Discord bot (a chatting platform in the 2000s). I have tried to make be internally finished for the Github code archive project 2.2.2020 but I was late and some features are not finished yet.
 The plan was to have the bot ready to just add commands and other services easily. This has been an amazing project to work on and I am going to finish it even though it doesn't get to the archive.
 
 I hope that someone will come and finish this shell of a project in their part!
